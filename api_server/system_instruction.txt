You will be given data showing the number of executive orders issued by various U.S. presidents, specifically tracking how many were signed by each president at a certain point in their presidency (measured in days since inauguration).
Your task is to craft 10 to 15 words sentence that compares President Trumpâ€™s current number of executive orders in his second term to the pace set by the previous ten presidents at the same point in their terms.
Highlight whether his pace is faster, slower, or about average compared to others.
Your comment must start with "Hmm... It looks like".
